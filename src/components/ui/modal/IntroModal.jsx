        Welcome to Arlo's Nintendo 2022 E3 Bingo!
      </center></h2>
      <h3>What is this?</h3>
      <p>
        This is just... Bingo! Arlo made a few predictions about Nintendo's E3 Direct
        and I wanted to have a little fun and figured I'd share it with the community.
      </p><p>
        Of course, <b>you don't have to pay any money to play</b>. This is just for fun.
      </p>
      <h3>What are the rules?</h3>
      <p>
        The rules are pretty simple. When you load the page, your device will be assigned
        a random bingo card. Either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Watch Nintendo's E3 Direct (currently not officially announced) or;
        </li>
        <li>
          Watch Arlo's recap of the Direct when it comes out.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When something comes up that's on your bingo card, click it on your card and
        it'll get "punched" and auto-save to your device so you don't lose any
        progress if you have to stop watching.
      </p>
      <h3>What if I can't watch the Nintendo Direct when it airs?</h3>
      <p>
        That's okay! The beauty of technology is that nothing has to be on time anymore.
      </p>
      <h3>I have questions, where can I get more info?</h3>
      <p>
        You can find more information about this application in the FAQ.
